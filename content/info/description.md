Galeria LUTNIȚA, based in Chișinău, is a project initiated by Moldovan artist Andrei Sclifos, with the support of the Plan B Foundation in Cluj, coordinated by Mihai Pop.

Inaugurated in the autumn of 2022, the gallery is dedicated to curating and showcasing a diverse range of contemporary practices by both emerging and established figures from the local and international art communities.

In 2025, the gallery resumes its activity in Chișinău in a new space, while also inaugurating a second venue in the village of Ustia. This dual structure reinforces the commitment of LUTNIȚA to developing context-responsive exhibitions and foster dialogue between contemporary artistic practices and their environments.

LUTNIȚA is committed to supporting relevant contemporary practices and to building meaningful and lasting connections across different art scenes, while also caring for the multifaceted artistic heritage and cultural background of the local artistic community.
